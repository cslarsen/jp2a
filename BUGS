TODO
- About process_scanline, it might be much better (clearer, faster) to pass a function pointer to the
  read pixels algorithm, so we don't have to do all those "if"s in the innerloop.  Might also be slower, though,
  because of the increased stack pushing and popping.
- Check j2pa --color ~/tmp/cola.jpg, should not get blue color there, because we are using grayscale colors!
- Consider using Bresenham scaling (search for "Image scanling with Bresenham" on DDJ.com)
- Consider using other libs for image conversions, e.g. would be nice to read GIF and PNG.  (See libpng, gdlib.)

BUGS
- Using --term-fit and multiple files, the fit only works for the first image.
- Floating-point calculation (and rounding) is not 100% equal from compiler to compiler.  Try to fix this.
