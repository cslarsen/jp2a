- Function signatures changed; added const where applicable
- Reintroduced use of malloc
- Added check for alloca in configure.ac

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.2
- When reading multiple files, malloc complained when freeing memory.  Using
  alloca now instead, which does not complain (although it may seem a buffer
  overrun is lurking somewhere).

  image.

CHANGES SINCE 0.9.1

  missing scanlines in output image.
